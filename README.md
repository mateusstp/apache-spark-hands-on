## Overview

This repository contains hands-on exercises and notebooks for learning Apache Spark using Python. The notebooks are designed to help you understand the core concepts of Spark and how to apply them in real-world scenarios.

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive guide to mastering Apache Spark using Python. It includes a series of hands-on exercises and notebooks that cover various aspects of Spark, such as data processing, machine learning, and streaming. By working through these exercises, users will gain practical experience and a deeper understanding of Spark's capabilities.

## Apache Exercises Folder

The `apache-spark` directory contains all the necessary resources for the hands-on exercises. It is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **data**: This folder includes datasets required for the exercises. Users can utilize these datasets to practice data manipulation and analysis using Spark.
- **python**: This folder contains Python scripts and notebooks that demonstrate different Spark functionalities. Each script is designed to illustrate a specific concept or use case, making it easier for users to follow along and implement their solutions.

### Python Subdirectories

- **advanced-examples**: Contains more complex examples that demonstrate advanced Spark functionalities and use cases.
- **spark-basics-rdd**: Focuses on the basics of Spark RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset), covering fundamental operations and transformations.
- **spark-sql-datafram-datasets**: Provides examples related to Spark SQL, DataFrames, and Datasets, showcasing how to perform SQL-like queries and operations.

Make sure to explore these directories to fully benefit from the learning materials provided in this project.
